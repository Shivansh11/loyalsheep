		<h1>Are you new to Unity?</h1>
		<div class="txt">
		<p class="date">May 6, 2017 - Shivansh Agrawal</p>	
		<p class="desc">Yes? Well, that's great because Unity is one of the best game engines out there. The problem is that you don't know for sure what might help you tame this beast. There are tons of tutorials and resources out there to get you started. But then again, you don't know what's best for you. Afraid not, I can point you in the right direction because I know what the real issue is with the beginners.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are two things which you need to learn in Unity to make your awesome game. The first one is the Unity's interface. It consists of buttons, options, views, menus...everything! Sounds boring? It is not! What are you!? The second thing is the actual scripting stuff. Oh and if you don't know how to write basic programs in JavaScript or C#, first learn one of those languages (or both). Basic understanding of a language will be sufficient for you to build a game like Flappy Bird or something similar. And that's pretty much it!</p><p>Best tutorials for learning Unity's interface are at their official website. Just watch those live sessions and things will start making sense! Call yourself a Unity's interface ninja after watching these two tutorials: <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials/editor-basics?playlist=17090" target="_blank">Tutorial 1</a> & <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials/game-objects?playlist=17090" target="_blank">Tutorial 2</a>.</p><p>Next you might find the following collection helpful for your scripting stuff - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RmYmP19OimzWSy2PpLxMk7" target="_blank">This one</a>. Looking for an awesome youtube channel to follow along? Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys" target="_blank">Brackeys</a>. A word of advice, don't just sit and watch tutorials. Develop something good and small of your own, side by side. Also, if you get stuck somewhere, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">forum.unity3d.com</a> are the best places to look up for a solution. They both have a great community! Good luck!</p>
